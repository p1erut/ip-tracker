# Frontend Mentor - IP Address Tracker

Hello! The idea for project is from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). 
There is only my own sollution!

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.


## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app. To get the IP Address locations, you'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, I used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## Tehnologies I used to complete the challenge

 - SCSS
 - jQuery
 - Ajax
 - LeafletJS
 - IP Geolocation API by IPify
